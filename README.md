# xry_1
XPU Array Library

## Overview
xry_1 is a high-performance array library designed for Xtream Processing Units (XPUs). This library aims to provide the fastest array operations for XPU development.

## Rust Implementation
We have transitioned the xry_1 library from C++ to Rust to leverage Rust's performance features and memory safety. The Rust implementation includes:

- Multi-dimensional array support
- SIMD-friendly data layouts
- Basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation capabilities
- XPU compatibility layer

## Features
- High-performance array operations
- Cross-device compatibility
- Optimized for XPU development

## Usage
(Usage instructions will be added as the implementation progresses)

## Contributing
Contributions to improve xry_1's performance and functionality are welcome. Please refer to our contributing guidelines (to be added) for more information.
